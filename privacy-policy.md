What data the Persian Calendar app might collect, store and process
===

The app only records data strictly necessary for its function, which is the app settings. The app does not include any advertisement libraries or any 3rd party tracking (analytics) code, such as Google Analytics.

All data provided and created when using the app is stored locally on your device. The app does not send or upload your data as it doesn't get Internet access from the system.

App permissions
===

The app requests the following privacy-relevant Android permissions:

* Access location only in the foreground: User requested opt-in to set location locally on the app, which further improves calendar-related algorithms and functions (owghat times, season pictures, etc.).
* Read calendar events and details: User requested opt-in to show calendar events in the calendar.

What app data other parties might collect, store and process
===

* Google: If you have activated backup & reset in your phone settings (Settings → Backup & Reset → Back up my data), you should be aware that Android itself will periodically save a copy of your phone’s data on Google’s servers. It may also include data from Persian Calendar and from other apps you use. The developers of the Persian Calendar do not have access to this data.

What data the Persian Calendar core team may have access to
