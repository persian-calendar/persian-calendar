Persian Calendar is developed and maintained by individual volunteers and not represented by any legal entity. The community doesn't need your data, so the app are designed to be fully GDPR compliant. Read on to learn more.

What data the Persian Calendar app might collect, store and process
===

The app only records data strictly necessary for its function, which is the app settings, last shown tab, last installed version, and very minor things like that. The app does not include any advertisement libraries or any 3rd party tracking (analytics) code, such as Google Analytics.

All data provided and created when using the app is stored locally on your device. The app does not send or upload your data as it doesn't get Internet access from the system.

App permissions
===

The app requests the following privacy-relevant Android permissions:

* Access location only in the foreground: User requested opt-in to set location locally on the app, which further improves calendar-related algorithms and functions (owghat times, season pictures, etc.).
* Read calendar events and details: User requested opt-in to show calendar events in the calendar.

What app data other parties might collect, store and process
===

* Google: If you have activated backup & reset in your phone settings (Settings → Backup & Reset → Back up my data), you should be aware that Android itself will periodically save a copy of your phone’s data on Google’s servers. It may also include data from Persian Calendar and from other apps you use. The developers of the Persian Calendar do not have access to this data.
* Device provided geocoder service: When location is set on the app by GPS or manually by coordinations or clicking on the map, the app asks from [device provided geocoder service](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder) about your location name so it can show it to yourself in the app. It is optional and you can either choose from available list of cities on the app or disconnect from Internet so coordinations can be set on the app without geocoder service query or you can just don't set location which isn't needed for functioning of the app.

What data the Persian Calendar core team may have access to
===

The developers of Persian Calendar do not have access to any of your information, except when you

* Actively share debugging information (either via email using the personal email function or via the Android crash reporting functionality of Google):
  * your publicly available name and email address
  * device type
  * Android version
  * Persian Calendar version
